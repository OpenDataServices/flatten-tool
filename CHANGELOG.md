## [Unreleased]

### Added

- --preserve-fields option to the cli so the user can specify which fields to keep when flattening, instead of defaulting to all of them

## Fixed

- Correct cell source map when hashcomments is used.

### Changed

- Using --rollup with `flatten` accepts fields to roll up as input directly and via a file, as well as via a schema.

## [0.7.0] - 2019-04-08

## Fixed

- Ignore NoneType in json instead of giving a TypeError.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-03-25

### Added

- A -v verbose option to the cli to generate more verbose output.
- A --truncation-length option to create-template and flatten
- A --no-deprecated-fields option to create-template.

### Changed

- Output on the command line is by default less verbose
- openpyxl of at least 2.6 is required https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool/issues/287
- For Python 3, 3.5 or later is required
- (XML only) Ensure the same path isn't split across multiple sheets - https://github.com/OpenDataServices/flatten-tool/pull/293

## [0.5.0] - 2018-11-13

### Added

- While trying to decode JSON, if there is a UTF8 error raise the new exception class BadlyFormedJSONErrorUTF8.
  (This extends the old BadlyFormedJSONError exception, so existing code that checks sensibly should be fine.)

- Add --disable-local-refs to flatten, unflatten and create-template.
- Add --remove-empty-schema-columns flag to flatten  https://github.com/OpenDataServices/cove/issues/1019
- Add --xml-comment to unflatten.

### Changed

- Commands from command line overridden individually by commands in the metatab. Previously all commands taken from metatab and the rest ignored if only one was added.

### Fixed

- In setup.py, set author and author_email to general values.

### Fixed

- create-template: If --output-format is xlsx, the default --output-name is template.xlsx instead of template.
- flatten: If --output-format is xlsx, the default --output-name is flattened.xlsx instead of flattened.
